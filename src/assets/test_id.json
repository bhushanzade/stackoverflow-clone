Which in the end, will consume the same resource without branch prediction, or even slower because we need to correct mistakes?"},{"owner":{"badge_counts":{"bronze":24,"silver":10,"gold":0},"reputation":1719,"user_id":10915534,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/IcLqB.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ibnelaiq","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10915534/ibnelaiq"},"reply_to_user":{"badge_counts":{"bronze":11,"silver":1,"gold":0},"reputation":96,"user_id":13830841,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GiTKeJoO6XlvqYIKBwy8DomvzAr7NzTIFGCxDZw=k-s128","display_name":"Hanna Mcquaig","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/13830841/hanna-mcquaig"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1607497541,"post_id":11227902,"comment_id":115287811,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","body":"@HannaMcquaig Always has been"},{"owner":{"badge_counts":{"bronze":29,"silver":14,"gold":0},"reputation":1678,"user_id":899213,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1cecebaf65cdd9a8351fdda654e5bdac?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Raphael","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/899213/raphael"},"reply_to_user":{"badge_counts":{"bronze":7,"silver":0,"gold":0},"reputation":67,"user_id":8736053,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/516a059907ce44673c7c18b92146d4a1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mycotina","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8736053/mycotina"},"edited":false,"score":5,"creation_date":1609861882,"post_id":11227902,"comment_id":115951193,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","body":"@Mycotina, I&#39;m no expert, but what I understand is: the processor needs multiple steps to execute a single instruction (fetching, decoding, etc) -- this is called &quot;instruction pipelining&quot; -- so, as an optimization, it will fetch multiple instructions at once and &quot;warm up&quot; the next instructions while executing the current one.

You have no idea which way it will go. What do you do? You halt execution and wait until the previous instructions are complete.

I admit it's not the best analogy since the train could just signal the direction with a flag. But in computers, the processor doesn't know which direction a branch will go until the last moment.</p>\n<p>So how would you strategically guess to minimize the number of times that the train must back up and go down the other path? You look at the past history! If the train goes left 99% of the time, then you guess left. If it alternates, then you alternate your guesses. If it goes one way every three times, you guess the same...</p>\n<p><em><strong>In other words, you try to identify a pattern and follow it.</strong></em> This is more or less how branch predictors work.</p>\n<p>Most applications have well-behaved branches. So modern branch predictors will typically achieve &gt;90% hit rates. But when faced with unpredictable branches with no recognizable patterns, branch predictors are virtually useless.</p>\n<p>Further reading: <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_predictor\" rel=\"noreferrer\">&quot;Branch predictor&quot; article on Wikipedia</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>As hinted from above, the culprit is this if-statement:</h2>\n<pre><code>if (data[c] &gt;= 128)\n    sum += data[c];\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice that the data is evenly distributed between 0 and 255. When the data is sorted, roughly the first half of the iterations will not enter the if-statement. After that, they will all enter the if-statement.</p>\n<p>This is very friendly to the branch predictor since the branch consecutively goes the same direction many times. Even a simple saturating counter will correctly predict the branch except for the few iterations after it switches direction.</p>\n<p><strong>Quick visualization:</strong></p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>T = branch taken\nN = branch not taken\n\ndata[] = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, ... 250, 251, 252, ...\nbranch = N  N  N  N  N  ...

TTTTTTTTTT  (easy to predict)\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, when the data is completely random, the branch predictor is rendered useless, because it can't predict random data. Thus there will probably be around 50% misprediction (no better than random guessing).</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>data[] = 226, 185, 125, 158, 198, 144, 217, 79, 202, 118,  14, 150, 177, 182, ...\nbranch =   T,   T,   N,   T,   T,   T,   T,  N,   T,   N,   N,   T,   T,   T  ...\n\n       = TTNTTTTNTNNTTT ...

This type of branch can be easily transformed into a <strong>conditional move</strong> statement, which would be compiled into a conditional move instruction: <code>cmovl</code>, in an <code>x86</code> system. The branch and thus the potential branch prediction penalty is removed.</p>\n<p>In <code>C</code>, thus <code>C++</code>, the statement, which would compile directly (without any optimization) into the conditional move instruction in <code>x86</code>, is the ternary operator <code>... ? ... : ...</code>. So we rewrite the above statement into an equivalent one:</p>\n<pre><code>sum += data[c] &gt;=128 ? data[c] : 0;\n</code></pre>\n<p>While maintaining readability, we can check the speedup factor.</p>\n<p>On an Intel <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Core#Core_i7\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Core i7</a>-2600K @ 3.4 GHz and Visual Studio 2010 Release Mode, the benchmark is:</p>\n<p><strong>x86</strong></p>\n<div class=\"s-table-container\">\n<table class=\"s-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Scenario</th>\n<th>Time (seconds)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Branching - Random data</td>\n<td>8.885</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Branching - Sorted data</td>\n<td>1.528</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Branchless - Random data</td>\n<td>3.716</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Branchless - Sorted data</td>\n<td>3.71</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p><strong>x64</strong></p>\n<div class=\"s-table-container\">\n<table class=\"s-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Scenario</th>\n<th>Time (seconds)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Branching - Random data</td>\n<td>11.302</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Branching - Sorted data</td>\n<td>1.830</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Branchless - Random data</td>\n<td>2.736</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Branchless - Sorted data</td>\n<td>2.737</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>The result is robust in multiple tests. We get a great speedup when the branch result is unpredictable, but we suffer a little bit when it is predictable. In fact, when using a conditional move, the performance is the same regardless of the data pattern.</p>\n<p>Now let's look more closely by investigating the <code>x86</code> assembly they generate. For simplicity, we use two functions <code>max1</code> and <code>max2</code>.</p>\n<p><code>max1</code> uses the conditional branch <code>if... else ...</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>int max1(int a, int b) {\n    if (a &gt; b)\n        return a;\n    else\n        return b;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>max2</code> uses the ternary operator <code>... ? ... : ...</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>int max2(int a, int b) {\n    return a &gt; b ? a : b;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>On a x86-64 machine, <code>GCC -S</code> generates the assembly below.</p>\n<pre><code>:max1\n    movl    %edi, -4(%rbp)\n    movl    %esi, -8(%rbp)\n    movl    -4(%rbp), %eax\n    cmpl    -8(%rbp), %eax\n    jle     .L2\n    movl    -4(%rbp), %eax\n    movl    %eax, -12(%rbp)\n    jmp     .L4\n.L2:\n    movl    -8(%rbp), %eax\n    movl    %eax, -12(%rbp)\n.L4:\n    movl    -12(%rbp), %eax\n    leave\n    ret\n\n:max2\n    movl    %edi, -4(%rbp)\n    movl    %esi, -8(%rbp)\n    movl    -4(%rbp), %eax\n    cmpl    %eax, -8(%rbp)\n    cmovge  -8(%rbp), %eax\n    leave\n    ret\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>max2</code> uses much less code due to the usage of instruction <code>cmovge</code>. But the real gain is that <code>max2</code> does not involve branch jumps, <code>jmp</code>, which would have a significant performance penalty if the predicted result is not right.</p>\n<p>So why does a conditional move perform better?</p>\n<p>In a typical <code>x86</code> processor, the execution of an instruction is divided into several stages. Roughly, we have different hardware to deal with different stages. So we do not have to wait for one instruction to finish to start a new one. This is called <strong><a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(computing)\" rel=\"noreferrer\">pipelining</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>In a branch case, the following instruction is determined by the preceding one, so we cannot do pipelining. We have to either wait or predict.</p>\n<p>In a conditional move case, the execution conditional move instruction is divided into several stages, but the earlier stages like <code>Fetch</code> and <code>Decode</code> do not depend on the result of the previous instruction; only latter stages need the result. Thus, we wait a fraction of one instruction's execution time. This is why the conditional move version is slower than the branch when the prediction is easy.</p>\n<p>The book <em><a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0136108040\" rel=\"noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective, second edition</a></em> explains this in detail. You can check Section 3.6.6 for <em>Conditional Move Instructions</em>, entire Chapter 4 for <em>Processor Architecture</em>, and Section 5.11.2 for special treatment for <em>Branch Prediction and Misprediction Penalties</em>.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, some modern compilers can optimize our code to assembly with better performance, sometimes some compilers can't (the code in question is using Visual Studio's native compiler). Knowing the performance difference between a branch and a conditional move when unpredictable can help us write code with better performance when the scenario gets so complex that the compiler can not optimize them automatically.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"badge_counts":{"bronze":90,"silver":51,"gold":8},"reputation":29421,"user_id":863980,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ea08c9063ae1de86e8d576fb569d513a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"vulcan raven","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/863980/vulcan-raven"},"last_editor":{"badge_counts":{"bronze":123,"silver":94,"gold":21},"reputation":27825,"user_id":63550,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RIZKi.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Peter Mortensen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/63550/peter-mortensen"},"comment_count":0,"up_vote_count":2411,"is_accepted":false,"score":2388,"last_activity_date":1558961493,"last_edit_date":1558961493,"creation_date":1341282330,"answer_id":11303693,"question_id":11227809,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","body":"<p>If you are curious about even more optimizations that can be done to this code, consider this:</p>\n\n<p>Starting with the original loop:</p>\n\n<pre><code>for (unsigned i = 0; i &lt; 100000; ++i)\n{\n    for (unsigned j = 0; j &lt; arraySize; ++j)\n    {\n        if (data[j] &gt;= 128)\n            sum += data[j];\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With loop interchange, we can safely change this loop to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>for (unsigned j = 0; j &lt; arraySize; ++j)\n{\n    for (unsigned i = 0; i &lt; 100000; ++i)\n    {\n        if (data[j] &gt;= 128)\n            sum += data[j];\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then, you can see that the <code>if</code> conditional is constant throughout the execution of the <code>i</code> loop, so you can hoist the <code>if</code> out:</p>\n\n<pre><code>for (unsigned j = 0; j &lt; arraySize; ++j)\n{\n    if (data[j] &gt;= 128)\n    {\n        for (unsigned i = 0; i &lt; 100000; ++i)\n        {\n            sum += data[j];\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then, you see that the inner loop can be collapsed into one single expression, assuming the floating point model allows it (<code>/fp:fast</code> is thrown, for example)</p>\n\n<pre><code>for (unsigned j = 0; j &lt; arraySize; ++j)\n{\n    if (data[j] &gt;= 128)\n    {\n        sum += data[j] * 100000;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That one is 100,000 times faster than before.</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"badge_counts":{"bronze":13,"silver":8,"gold":0},"reputation":1140,"user_id":2383730,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/giP28.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"TallBrian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2383730/tallbrian"},"edited":false,"score":86,"creation_date":1386561609,"post_id":12853037,"comment_id":30576818,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"This is scary, in the unsorted list, there should be 50% chance of hitting the add.

To compensate for the difference in speed, a couple of caches are built into your processor (L1/L2 cache). So imagine that you're doing your nice calculations and figure out that you need a piece of memory. The processor will get its 'load' operation and loads the piece of memory into cache -- and then uses the cache to do the rest of the calculations. Because memory is relatively slow, this 'load' will slow down your program.</p>\n\n<p>Like branch prediction, this was optimized in the Pentium processors: the processor predicts that it needs to load a piece of data and attempts to load that into the cache before the operation actually hits the cache. As we've already seen, branch prediction sometimes goes horribly wrong -- in the worst case scenario you need to go back and actually wait for a memory load, which will take forever (<strong>in other words: failing branch prediction is bad, a memory load after a branch prediction fail is just horrible!</strong>).</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately for us, if the memory access pattern is predictable, the processor will load it in its fast cache and all is well.</p>\n\n<p>The first thing we need to know is what is <em>small</em>? While smaller is generally better, a rule of thumb is to stick to lookup tables that are &lt;= 4096 bytes in size. As an upper limit: if your lookup table is larger than 64K it's probably worth reconsidering.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Constructing a table</strong></p>\n\n<p>So we've figured out that we can create a small table. Next thing to do is get a lookup function in place. Lookup functions are usually small functions that use a couple of basic integer operations (and, or, xor, shift, add, remove and perhaps multiply). You want to have your input translated by the lookup function to some kind of 'unique key' in your table, which then simply gives you the answer of all the work you wanted it to do.</p>\n\n<p>In this case: >= 128 means we can keep the value, &lt; 128 means we get rid of it. The easiest way to do that is by using an 'AND': if we keep it, we AND it with 7FFFFFFF; if we want to get rid of it, we AND it with 0. Notice also that 128 is a power of 2 -- so we can go ahead and make a table of 32768/128 integers and fill it with one zero and a lot of 7FFFFFFFF's.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Managed languages</strong></p>\n\n<p>You might wonder why this works well in managed languages. After all, managed languages check the boundaries of the arrays with a branch to ensure you don't mess up...</p>\n\n<p>Well, not exactly... :-)</p>\n\n<p>There has been quite some work on eliminating this branch for managed languages. For example:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"lang-cs prettyprint-override\"><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; array.Length; ++i)\n{\n   // Use array[i]\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this case, it's obvious to the compiler that the boundary condition will never be hit. At least the Microsoft JIT compiler (but I expect Java does similar things) will notice this and remove the check altogether. WOW, that means no branch. Similarly, it will deal with other obvious cases.</p>\n\n<p>If you run into trouble with lookups in managed languages -- the key is to add a <code>&amp; 0x[something]FFF</code> to your lookup function to make the boundary check predictable -- and watch it going faster.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The result of this case</strong></p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-cs prettyprint-override\"><code>// Generate data\nint arraySize = 32768;\nint[] data = new int[arraySize];\n\nRandom random = new Random(0);\nfor (int c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)\n{\n    data[c] = random.Next(256);\n}\n\n/*To keep the spirit of the code intact, I'll make a separate lookup table\n(I assume we cannot modify 'data' or the number of loops)*/\n\nint[] lookup = new int[256];\n\nfor (int c = 0; c &lt; 256; ++c)\n{\n    lookup[c] = (c &gt;= 128) ? c : 0;\n}\n\n// Test\nDateTime startTime = System.DateTime.Now;\nlong sum = 0;\n\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; 100000; ++i)\n{\n    // Primary loop\n    for (int j = 0; j &lt; arraySize; ++j)\n    {\n        /* Here you basically want to use simple operations - so no\n        random branches, but things like &amp;, |, *, -, +, etc. are fine. */\n        sum += lookup[data[j]];\n    }\n}\n\nDateTime endTime = System.DateTime.Now;\nConsole.WriteLine(endTime - startTime);\nConsole.WriteLine(\"sum = \" + sum);\nConsole.ReadLine();\n</code></pre>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"badge_counts":{"bronze":72,"silver":52,"gold":3},"reputation":27442,"user_id":1031591,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/s3MiH.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"atlaste","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1031591/atlaste"},"edited":false,"score":36,"creation_date":1375099524,"post_id":17782979,"comment_id":26185793,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"Right, you can also just use the bit directly and multiply (<code>data[c]&gt;&gt;7</code> - which is discussed somewhere here as well); I intentionally left this solution out, but of course you are correct.

Hmm, your examples were conditional... the idea is that once you extract the bit from flags, you can just use indexing with no branch."},{"owner":{"badge_counts":{"bronze":26,"silver":29,"gold":2},"reputation":5832,"user_id":3950982,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7491f45ae073ed6bfe01b1e63fb06bf0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Luke Hutchison","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3950982/luke-hutchison"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1551357444,"post_id":17782979,"comment_id":96616372,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","body":"Bit shifting is a zero-cost operation in ARM, so you may find the bit-shifted version is faster on ARM."},{"owner":{"badge_counts":{"bronze":123,"silver":94,"gold":21},"reputation":27825,"user_id":63550,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RIZKi.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Peter Mortensen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/63550/peter-mortensen"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1558962425,"post_id":17782979,"comment_id":99261002,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","body":"What about cache sizes, L1, L2, etc.?

Stefan de Bruijn discussed that in his answer.</p>\n<p>But in this case, we know values are in the range [0, 255] and we only care about values &gt;= 128.  That means we can easily extract a single bit that will tell us whether we want a value or not: by shifting the data to the right 7 bits, we are left with a 0 bit or a 1 bit, and we only want to add the value when we have a 1 bit.  Let's call this bit the &quot;decision bit&quot;.</p>\n<p>By using the 0/1 value of the decision bit as an index into an array, we can make code that will be equally fast whether the data is sorted or not sorted.  Our code will always add a value, but when the decision bit is 0, we will add the value somewhere we don't care about.  Here's the code:</p>\n<pre><code>// Test\nclock_t start = clock();\nlong long a[] = {0, 0};\nlong long sum;\n\nfor (unsigned i = 0; i &lt; 100000; ++i)\n{\n    // Primary loop\n    for (unsigned c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)\n    {\n        int j = (data[c] &gt;&gt; 7);\n        a[j] += data[c];\n    }\n}\n\ndouble elapsedTime = static_cast&lt;double&gt;(clock() - start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;\nsum = a[1];\n</code></pre>\n<p>This code wastes half of the adds but never has a branch prediction failure.  It's tremendously faster on random data than the version with an actual if statement.</p>\n<p>But in my testing, an explicit lookup table was slightly faster than this, probably because indexing into a lookup table was slightly faster than bit shifting.  This shows how my code sets up and uses the lookup table (unimaginatively called <code>lut</code> for &quot;LookUp Table&quot; in the code).  Here's the C++ code:</p>\n<pre><code>// Declare and then fill in the lookup table\nint lut[256];\nfor (unsigned c = 0; c &lt; 256; ++c)\n    lut[c] = (c &gt;= 128) ? c : 0;\n\n// Use the lookup table after it is built\nfor (unsigned i = 0; i &lt; 100000; ++i)\n{\n    // Primary loop\n    for (unsigned c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)\n    {\n        sum += lut[data[c]];\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this case, the lookup table was only 256 bytes, so it fits nicely in a cache and all was fast.  This technique wouldn't work well if the data was 24-bit values and we only wanted half of them... the lookup table would be far too big to be practical.  On the other hand, we can combine the two techniques shown above: first shift the bits over, then index a lookup table.  For a 24-bit value that we only want the top half value, we could potentially shift the data right by 12 bits, and be left with a 12-bit value for a table index.  A 12-bit table index implies a table of 4096 values, which might be practical.</p>\n<p>The technique of indexing into an array, instead of using an <code>if</code> statement, can be used for deciding which pointer to use.  I saw a library that implemented binary trees, and instead of having two named pointers (<code>pLeft</code> and <code>pRight</code> or whatever) had a length-2 array of pointers and used the &quot;decision bit&quot; technique to decide which one to follow.  For example, instead of:</p>\n<pre><code>if (x &lt; node-&gt;value)\n    node = node-&gt;pLeft;\nelse\n    node = node-&gt;pRight;\n</code></pre>\n<p>this library would do something like:</p>\n<pre><code>i = (x &lt; node-&gt;value);\nnode = node-&gt;link[i];\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here's a link to this code: <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190207151651/https://www.eternallyconfuzzled.com/tuts/datastructures/jsw_tut_rbtree.aspx\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Red Black Trees</a>, <em>Eternally Confuzzled</em></p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"badge_counts":{"bronze":559,"silver":412,"gold":43},"reputation":323972,"user_id":85371,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":43,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6d52c235ec6dd15f30bab444103e7af2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"sehe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/85371/sehe"},"edited":false,"score":28,"creation_date":1374683490,"post_id":17828251,"comment_id":26040119,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"<code>sum= 3137536</code> - clever.

To understand this better please see this <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(computing)#Concept_and_motivation\" rel=\"noreferrer\">example on Wikipedia</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Generally, modern processors have quite long pipelines, but for ease let's consider these 4 steps only.</p>\n\n<ol>  \n  <li>IF -- Fetch the instruction from memory \n  <li>ID -- Decode the instruction\n  <li>EX -- Execute the instruction \n  <li>WB -- Write back to CPU register\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong><em>4-stage pipeline in general for 2 instructions.</em></strong>\n<img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/PqBBR.png\" alt=\"4-stage pipeline in general\"></p>\n\n<p>Moving back to the above question let's consider the following instructions:</p>\n\n<pre><code>                        A) if (data[c] &gt;= 128)\n                                /\\\n                               /  \\\n                              /    \\\n                        true /      \\ false\n                            /        \\\n                           /          \\\n                          /            \\\n                         /              \\\n              B) sum += data[c];          C) for loop or print().\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Without branch prediction, the following would occur:</p>\n\n<p>To execute instruction B or instruction C the processor will have to wait till the instruction A doesn't reach till EX stage in the pipeline, as the decision to go to instruction B or instruction C depends on the result of instruction A. So the pipeline will look like this.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>when if condition returns true:</em></strong>\n<img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0H4gP.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>When if condition returns false:</em></strong>\n<img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/APpca.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>As a result of waiting for the result of instruction A, the total CPU cycles spent in the above case (without branch prediction; for both true and false) is 7.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So what is branch prediction?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Branch predictor will try to guess which way a branch (an if-then-else structure) will go before this is known for sure. It will not wait for the instruction A to reach the EX stage of the pipeline, but it will guess the decision and go to that instruction (B or C in case of our example).</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>In case of a correct guess, the pipeline looks something like this:</em></strong>\n<img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZYUbs.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>If it is later detected that the guess was wrong then the partially executed instructions are discarded and the pipeline starts over with the correct branch, incurring a delay. \nThe time that is wasted in case of a branch misprediction is equal to the number of stages in the pipeline from the fetch stage to the execute stage. Modern microprocessors tend to have quite long pipelines so that the misprediction delay is between 10 and 20 clock cycles. The longer the pipeline the greater the need for a good <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_predictor\" rel=\"noreferrer\">branch predictor</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In the OP's code, the first time when the conditional, the branch predictor does not have any information to base up prediction, so the first time it will randomly choose the next instruction. Later in the for loop, it can base the prediction on the history. \nFor an array sorted in ascending order, there are three possibilities:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li> All the elements are less than 128\n<li> All the elements are greater than 128\n<li> Some starting new elements are less than 128 and later it become greater than 128\n</ol>\n\n<p>Let us assume that the predictor will always assume the true branch on the first run.</p>\n\n<p>So in the first case, it will always take the true branch since historically all its predictions are correct.\nIn the 2nd case, initially it will predict wrong, but after a few iterations, it will predict correctly.\nIn the 3rd case, it will initially predict correctly till the elements are less than 128. After which it will fail for some time and the correct itself when it sees branch prediction failure in history. </p>\n\n<p>In all these cases the failure will be too less in number and as a result, only a few times it will need to discard the partially executed instructions and start over with the correct branch, resulting in fewer CPU cycles. </p>\n\n<p>But in case of a random unsorted array, the prediction will need to discard the partially executed instructions and start over with the correct branch most of the time and result in more CPU cycles compared to the sorted array.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"badge_counts":{"bronze":55,"silver":34,"gold":5},"reputation":13624,"user_id":1313233,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hBeXC.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"rkachach","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1313233/rkachach"},"last_editor":{"badge_counts":{"bronze":68,"silver":51,"gold":5},"reputation":5598,"user_id":1372621,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0fqUn.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Stacked","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1372621/stacked"},"awarded_bounty_amount":100,"comment_count":0,"up_vote_count":747,"is_accepted":false,"score":746,"last_activity_date":1477650491,"last_edit_date":1477650491,"creation_date":1443020267,"answer_id":32742980,"question_id":11227809,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"<p>In the same line (I think this was not highlighted by any answer) it's good to mention that sometimes (specially in software where the performance mattersâlike in the Linux kernel) you can find some if statements like the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>if (likely( everything_is_ok ))\n{\n    /* Do something */\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or similarly:</p>\n\n<pre><code>if (unlikely(very_improbable_condition))\n{\n    /* Do something */    \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Both <code>likely()</code> and <code>unlikely()</code> are in fact macros that are defined by using something like the GCC's <code>__builtin_expect</code> to help the compiler insert prediction code to favour the condition taking into account the information provided by the user.

If these branches are inside loops and are hard to predict they can slow down execution significantly. Boolean variables are stored as 8-bit integers with the value <code>0</code> for <code>false</code> and <code>1</code> for <code>true</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Boolean variables are overdetermined in the sense that all operators that have Boolean variables as input check if the inputs have any other value than <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>, but operators that have Booleans as output can produce no other value than <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>. This makes operations with Boolean variables as input less efficient than necessary.\nConsider example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>bool a, b, c, d;\nc = a &amp;&amp; b;\nd = a || b;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is typically implemented by the compiler in the following way:</p>\n\n<pre><code>bool a, b, c, d;\nif (a != 0) {\n    if (b != 0) {\n        c = 1;\n    }\n    else {\n        goto CFALSE;\n    }\n}\nelse {\n    CFALSE:\n    c = 0;\n}\nif (a == 0) {\n    if (b == 0) {\n        d = 0;\n    }\n    else {\n        goto DTRUE;\n    }\n}\nelse {\n    DTRUE:\n    d = 1;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This code is far from optimal. The branches may take a long time in case of mispredictions. The Boolean operations can be made much more efficient if it is known with certainty that the operands have no other values than <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>. The reason why the compiler does not make such an assumption is that the variables might have other values if they are uninitialized or come from unknown sources. The above code can be optimized if <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> has been initialized to valid values or if they come from operators that produce Boolean output. The optimized code looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>char a = 0, b = 1, c, d;\nc = a &amp; b;\nd = a | b;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>char</code> is used instead of <code>bool</code> in order to make it possible to use the bitwise operators (<code>&amp;</code> and <code>|</code>) instead of the Boolean operators (<code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code>). The bitwise operators are single instructions that take only one clock cycle. The OR operator (<code>|</code>) works even if <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> have other values than <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>. The AND operator (<code>&amp;</code>) and the EXCLUSIVE OR operator (<code>^</code>) may give inconsistent results if the operands have other values than <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>.</p>\n\n<p><code>~</code> can not be used for NOT. Instead, you can make a Boolean NOT on a variable which is known to be <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> by XOR'ing it with <code>1</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>bool a, b;\nb = !a;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>can be optimized to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>char a = 0, b;\nb = a ^ 1;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>a &amp;&amp; b</code> cannot be replaced with <code>a &amp; b</code> if <code>b</code> is an expression that should not be evaluated if <code>a</code> is <code>false</code> ( <code>&amp;&amp;</code> will not evaluate <code>b</code>, <code>&amp;</code> will). Likewise, <code>a || b</code> can not be replaced with <code>a | b</code> if <code>b</code> is an expression that should not be evaluated if <code>a</code> is <code>true</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Using bitwise operators is more advantageous if the operands are variables than if the operands are comparisons:</p>\n\n<pre><code>bool a; double x, y, z;\na = x &gt; y &amp;&amp; z &lt; 5.0;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>is optimal in most cases (unless you expect the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> expression to generate many branch mispredictions).</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"badge_counts":{"bronze":35,"silver":20,"gold":3},"reputation":13552,"user_id":4013258,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1d423395e1033fa23d80a5561ab170fa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Surt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4013258/surt"},"last_editor":{"badge_counts":{"bronze":101,"silver":64,"gold":13},"reputation":18771,"user_id":234175,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/37f386df1c4e98d9ce0350431f590f2a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"greatwolf","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/234175/greatwolf"},"comment_count":0,"up_vote_count":777,"is_accepted":false,"score":776,"last_activity_date":1485862773,"last_edit_date":1485862773,"creation_date":1444597518,"answer_id":33070112,"question_id":11227809,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"<p>An official answer would be from</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/avoiding-the-cost-of-branch-misprediction\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Intel - Avoiding the Cost of Branch Misprediction</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/branch-and-loop-reorganization-to-prevent-mispredicts\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Intel - Branch and Loop Reorganization to Prevent Mispredicts</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=branch%20prediction%20computer%20architecture&amp;hl=da&amp;as_sdt=0&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholart\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Scientific papers - branch prediction computer architecture</a></li>\n<li>Books: J.L.

The branch is based on some condition, such as branching backwards to the beginning of a program loop when a test at the end of the loop states the loop should be executed again.</p>\n<p><strong>Unconditional branches</strong> - this includes jumps, procedure calls and returns that have no specific condition. For example, an unconditional jump instruction might be coded in assembly language as simply &quot;jmp&quot;, and the instruction stream must immediately be directed to the target location pointed to by the jump instruction, whereas a conditional jump that might be coded as &quot;jmpne&quot; would redirect the instruction stream only if the result of a comparison of two values in a previous &quot;compare&quot; instructions shows the values to not be equal.

Branch predictors play a critical role in\n  achieving high effective performance in many modern pipelined\n  microprocessor architectures such as x86.</p>\n  \n  <p>Two-way branching is usually implemented with a conditional jump\n  instruction. A conditional jump can either be \"not taken\" and continue\n  execution with the first branch of code which follows immediately\n  after the conditional jump, or it can be \"taken\" and jump to a\n  different place in program memory where the second branch of code is\n  stored. It is not known for certain whether a conditional jump will be\n  taken or not taken until the condition has been calculated and the\n  conditional jump has passed the execution stage in the instruction\n  pipeline (see fig. 1).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/unxnb.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/unxnb.png\" alt=\"figure 1\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Based on the described scenario, I have written an animation demo to show how instructions are executed in a pipeline in different situations.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Without the Branch Predictor. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Without branch prediction, the processor would have to wait until the\n  conditional jump instruction has passed the execute stage before the\n  next instruction can enter the fetch stage in the pipeline.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The example contains three instructions and the first one is a conditional jump instruction. The latter two instructions can go into the pipeline until the conditional jump instruction is executed. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/GMFQ6.gif\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/GMFQ6.gif\" alt=\"without branch predictor\"></a></p>\n\n<p>It will take 9 clock cycles for 3 instructions to be completed.</p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Use Branch Predictor and don't take a conditional jump.

Modern microprocessors tend to have quite long\n  pipelines so that the misprediction delay is between 10 and 20 clock\n  cycles. As a result, making a pipeline longer increases the need for a\n  more advanced branch predictor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As you can see, it seems we don't have a reason not to use Branch Predictor.</p>\n\n<p>It's quite a simple demo that clarifies the very basic part of Branch Predictor.

Updating status bits has side effects, therefore has a linearizing effect on code. <strong>ARM's ability to mix and match branch-free condition testing on any instruction with the option to either update or not update the status bits after any instruction is extremely powerful, for both assembly language programmers and compilers, and produces very efficient code.</strong></p>\n<p>When you don't have to branch, you can avoid the time cost of flushing the pipeline for what would otherwise be short branches, and you can avoid the design complexity of many forms of speculative evalution. The performance impact of the initial naive imlementations of the mitigations for many recently discovered processor vulnerabilities (Spectre etc.) shows you just how much the performance of modern processors depends upon complex speculative evaluation logic. With a short pipeline and the dramatically reduced need for branching, ARM just doesn't need to rely on speculative evaluation as much as CISC processors. (Of course high-end ARM implementations do include speculative evaluation, but it's a smaller part of the performance story.)</p>\n<p>If you have ever wondered why ARM has been so phenomenally successful, the brilliant effectiveness and interplay of these two mechanisms (combined with another mechanism that lets you &quot;barrel shift&quot; left or right one of the two arguments of any arithmetic operator or offset memory access operator at zero additional cost) are a big part of the story, because they are some of the greatest sources of the ARM architecture's efficiency.

Is it true? How would you know? It is a bad idea to answer questions about efficiency without first doing some measurements, so it is important to know how to measure.</p>\n<p>So, I tried with a vector of a million integers and got:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>Already sorted    32995 milliseconds\nShuffled          125944 milliseconds\n\nAlready sorted    18610 milliseconds\nShuffled          133304 milliseconds\n\nAlready sorted    17942 milliseconds\nShuffled          107858 milliseconds\n</code></pre>\n<p>I ran that a few times to be sure. Yes, the phenomenon is real. My key code was:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-cpp prettyprint-override\"><code>void run(vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; v, const string&amp; label)\n{\n    auto t0 = system_clock::now();\n    sort(v.begin(), v.end());\n    auto t1 = system_clock::now();\n    cout &lt;&lt; label\n         &lt;&lt; duration_cast&lt;microseconds&gt;(t1 â t0).count()\n         &lt;&lt; &quot; milliseconds\\n&quot;;\n}\n\nvoid tst()\n{\n    vector&lt;int&gt; v(1'000'000);\n    iota(v.begin(), v.end(), 0);\n    run(v, &quot;already sorted &quot;);\n    std::shuffle(v.begin(), v.end(), std::mt19937{ std::random_device{}() });\n    run(v, &quot;shuffled    &quot;);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>At least the phenomenon is real with this compiler, standard library, and optimizer settings. Different implementations can and do give different answers. In fact, someone did do a more systematic study (a quick web search will find it) and most implementations show that effect.</p>\n<p>One reason is branch prediction: the key operation in the sort algorithm is <code>âif(v[i] &lt; pivot]) â¦â</code> or equivalent. For a sorted sequence that test is always true whereas, for a random sequence, the branch chosen varies randomly.</p>\n<p>Another reason is that when the vector is already sorted, we never need to move elements to their correct position. The effect of these little details is the factor of five or six that we saw.</p>\n<p>Quicksort (and sorting in general) is a complex study that has attracted some of the greatest minds of computer science. A good sort function is a result of both choosing a good algorithm and paying attention to hardware performance in its implementation.</p>\n<p>If you want to write efficient code, you need to know a bit about machine architecture.</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"badge_counts":{"bronze":583,"silver":405,"gold":34},"reputation":236255,"user_id":224132,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/N4ivW.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Peter Cordes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/224132/peter-cordes"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1576247362,"post_id":58531294,"comment_id":104848500,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","body":"The instructions stay hot in the CPU&#39;s L1 instruction cache regardless of mispredicts.
